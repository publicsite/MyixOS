on BUILD, using TARGET toolchain, build cross compiler for CROSS_TARGET, where HOST=TARGET
on BUILD, using TARGET toolchain, build sysroot for TARGET, where HOST=TARGET

on the system we are building from, using the toolchain we use to compile, build a new cross compiler which can
build for a different system to that of the toolchain, where the system we will run the compiler on is the same as the toolchain
we use to compile.

on the system we are building from, using the toolchain we use to compile, build a sysroot that will run on the system we will run the
compiler on

i686

x86



for gcc
build=i686
host=x86_64
target=mingw

this will build using an i686 machine and an x86_64 cross compiler, a mingw compiler that runs on x86_64

for sysroot
build=i686
host=x86_64
target=x86_64
