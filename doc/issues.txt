wayland depends on libxcb and meson which depends on python
mesa depends on meson
xorg depends on libxcb which depends on python, and mesa, which depends on meson
automake is written in perl
linux also depends on perl (I think)
gcc requires a C++ compiler

These issues mean we have multiple build systems and multiple scripting languages
	instead of one build system and one scripting language.

We also have a C++ compiler, which you have to bootstrap from,
	which is unneccessary when you could just use C (not all systems have C++).

It's ugly.
