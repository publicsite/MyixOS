Both mingw and cygwin toolchains require a dynamic include to windows.h

ie.

#include <windows.h>

This is whether using the set of 'w64' toolchains for mingw/cygwin, or 'pc' for just cygwin, it is a depedency.

As of such, they both error out.

This might be able to be fixed by building with wine.

Wine is LGPL software according to wikipedia.

Wine may also be required to build perl 5 for windows as it stands.
